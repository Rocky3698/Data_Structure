Data Structures Repository
==========================

This repository contains a collection of data structures that I have learned and used for problem-solving. These data structures cover various areas such as trees, graphs, arrays, and more. They were learned as part of the Phitron XPSC Club, a competitive and problem-solving club.

## Data Structures
- **Array:**
  - Dynamic Array
  - Multidimensional Array
- **Linked List:**
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List
- **Stack:**
  - Array-based Stack
  - Linked List-based Stack
- **Queue:**
  - Array-based Queue
  - Linked List-based Queue
  - Circular Queue
  - Deque (Double-ended Queue)
- **Priority Queue:**
  - Min-Heap
  - Max-Heap
- **Tree:**
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - AVL Tree
  - Red-Black Tree
  - Segment Tree
  - Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
  - Trie (Prefix Tree)
- **Graph:**
  - Adjacency Matrix
  - Adjacency List
  - Incidence Matrix
- **Hash Table:**
  - Separate Chaining
  - Open Addressing (Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing, Double Hashing)
- **Set:**
  - Hash Set
  - Tree Set
- **Map:**
  - Hash Map
  - Tree Map
- **Other Data Structures:**
  - Disjoint Set (Union-Find)
  - Bloom Filter
  - Suffix Array

## How to Use
Each data structure is implemented in its own file with detailed comments explaining the steps and logic. You can browse through the repository to find the specific data structure you are interested in. The code is organized by category for easy navigation.
